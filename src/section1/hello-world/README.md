### hello world
The first program that we always write in a programming language is the Hello World program :cool:

#### main.d

```d
import std.stdio;

void main(string[] args) { /* Your first program */
	writeln("Hello, World!");
}
```

For example, if you have already programmed or are familiar with **C**, you will realize how good the **D** syntax is.
